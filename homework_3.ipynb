In this notebook we'll use linear regression to estimate the phase angle, line characteristics, power injections, flows, under various conditions."

    "First we'll need to go over a few definitions and matrices that you saw in class. Fig. 1 illustrates the IEEE-123 test feeder, a standardized distribution network used to test control algorithms and optimization techniques for application in real systems. Each _node_ in the graph is an electrical bus, and each _edge_ is a power line. In the programming assignment questions, we'll be looking at a much simpler, 8-bus network we design ourselves. Note that each bus has a number assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AC (DC) power flow, electricity is subject to impedance (resistance) over the power lines. We can represent this with a special $n x n$ matrix which characterizes this impedance at each node and between nodes. Based on how the power flow problem is simplified, the values of these matrix are called admittance or susceptance because these values become inverted, or only represent a real or imaginary part of the power flow. Regardless, the structure remains the same; we'll define the admittance matrix, $B$, as\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$B_{i,j} = \\begin{cases} \\sum_{k=1,\\ldots n} b_{i,k} & i = j \\\\ -b_{i,j} & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If two nodes $i,j$ are connected, the line has admittance $b_{i,j}$. The diagonal elements are the sum of the admittances of the lines connected to that node. The important takeaway is that the matrix $B$ characterizes the resistivity properties of the power lines and the power line topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a network, or _graph_ like the example in Fig. 1 with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, the node-edge incidence matrix is an $n x m$ matrix $F$ where each element is 1 if node $i$ is connection to node $j$, $-1$ if $j$ is connected to $i$ (we assign a direction), and 0 if no connection exists.\n",

    "\n",
    "In power engineering often time we'll assume a nominal voltage of 1 so that the power flow between busses is entirely characterized the by the AC phase angle difference between busses. If the phase angle differences are small, we can use the small angle approximation to _linearize_ the AC power flow equations. This is called the DC approximation as it resembles the equations for DC power flow. For a vector of bus voltage angles $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and unit voltage, then the power injection at each node,\n",

    "These are just linear equations, like we've seen in the previous homeworks. Moreover, phase angles are very difficult to measure, and we often work with many noisy samples of power injections and flows. For convenience, we can stack the two linear equation in a single equation:\n",
